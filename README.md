# Enclosure for the [TouchDRO DIY kit for glass scales](https://www.touchdro.com/store/diy-dro-kit-for-glass-scales.html)

This model provides an enclosure for the [TouchDRO DIY kit for glass scales](https://www.touchdro.com/store/diy-dro-kit-for-glass-scales.html).

The awesome [TouchDRO](https://www.touchdro.com/) project now offers an [inexpensive DIY kit](https://www.touchdro.com/store/diy-dro-kit-for-glass-scales.html) you can assemble yourself.  The kit doesn't include an enclosure, so I created one that might work out for you.

## BOM

To complete this assembly you will also need the following:

* [4x 35mm M4 socket-head screws](https://amzn.to/3xf0tDp)
* [4x M4 nuts](https://amzn.to/3v8zLuc)
* [8x 4-40 Jack Screws + nuts](https://amzn.to/2QPi0RX)
* [LocTite thread locker](https://amzn.to/3eq09ZM)

## Assembly

1. Print the top side and one of the two bottom half models. I've used [Overture PETG](https://amzn.to/3v2XJHk) with .20mm layers to good effect.  No supports should be required if your printer is dialed in.
2. Press-fit the [4x M4 nuts](https://amzn.to/3v8zLuc) into the two halves of the enclosure.
3. Mount the DB9 shells to the top enclosure with [8x 4-40 Jack Screws + nuts](https://amzn.to/2QPi0RX).  Use some [red LocTite](https://amzn.to/3eq09ZM) to keep this secured.
3. Place the top onto the enclosure and secure with [4x 35mm M4 socket-head screws](https://amzn.to/3xf0tDp)

## Notes

* For nice and readable text labels, print the [TouchDRO DIY enclosure top inlay](https://github.com/aderusha/TouchDRO-DIY-Enclosure/blob/main/TouchDRO_DIY_enclosure_top_inlay.stl) model in one color, leave that on your print bed, then print the rest of the [top enclosure model](https://github.com/aderusha/TouchDRO-DIY-Enclosure/blob/main/TouchDRO_DIY_enclosure_top.stl) over it.
